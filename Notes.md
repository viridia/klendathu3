# More Ideas

* Separate issue state from checkin state. (Latter managed by github or other vcs webhook).
* Comment attachments.
* A way to easily reference tickets in commit messages. (Just paste the url)
* Make certain fields editable without going into edit mode.
* Think about email spam. (Once we have email)
* Think about a global change history that would avoid the need for email spam.
* Gantt and ticket relationships.
* Auto-linked tickets.
* Think about how to make it easier to manage ticket relationships.
  * Drag links between cards?
  * Murally-style dragging of cards?  I kind of like that idea...
* Cloudwatch-style collapsing columns.
